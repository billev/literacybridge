1. Download and install Java 1.5 JRE or above, Apache Ant 1.7 or above,
   and Adobe Flex SDK 3.2 or above.

2. Edit build.properties and set flex.home to the Flex SDK's home directory.
   Note that also on Windows you have to use forward slashes and should avoid
	 a path with whitespaces, e. g. flex.home=C:/PROGRA~1/Adobe/flex_sdk_3_2

3. Go to the main directory of the authoring tool, e. g. authoring/trunk and 
   if you want to run the trunk version and run 'ant compile'.
	 
4. If you get an error like this: 
        Error: unable to open 'locale/de'
				
   then you need to use the copylocale tool that is located in the flex bin 
	 directory. Go to the flex home dir and run: 'bin/copylocale en_US de'

5. Run 'ant launch'; the AuthoringTool should start now.
