###merged from rev. 556


This is our current TODO list for adjusting Cliffs code.  Cliff's code adjusting
conventions are:

All changed code should be commented with:
		/* XXX: <your name> <your comment> */
	example:
		/* XXX: David D. Cast int to enum to remove compiler warning */

- A list of functions which do not link can be found by trying to compile/link
		tests/cliff_test, although do not save/commit the modified project or it
		will cause svn conflicts

- If you change the functionality of a line you should comment the old code so it
		is easier to track bugs introduced by us.
- All commenting should be with /* */ to separate our comments from Cliff's
- Any recurring compiler error/warnings you find should be noted at the bottom of
		this file so I can report them to Cliff. Mark them as - NOT REPORTED, I will
		change that once I report them to Cliff's bug tracker
- Any compiler warnings which will result in incorrect execution should be
		fixed, warnings which will not result in incorrect execution may be left or
		fixed at your discretion.


NOTE: All of Cliff's application code is in src/cliff/Application/TalkingBook/ DO NOT
				modify code outside of that, it is from G+ and it is very poorly written

Things we need to port:
	Any Assembly listing:
		device.c asm(nop) - Asking Cliff, may be able to use our timer

	All of Cliff's FS Calls to elm: -- Implementation - Done, TODO: testing
		Should Make compatibility layer for
			open
			close
			read
			write
			unlink
			getcwd
			rmdir
			chdir
			lseek
			_findfirst (traversing directories)
			_findnext (traversing directories)
			_copy (file to file copy)
			stat - NOTE: Compatibility layer should just return elm FILINFO and change
							Cliff's code to use that

	Cliff's audio calls:
		SACM*
		Snd_*
		NOTE: I emailed Cliff about this, I'm unsure of the interface difference, 
						awaiting response before editing

	Cliff's button input: -- Done!
		SP_GetCh
		KeyScan_ServiceLoop

Things we need to remove/defer: -- David Working on
	USB Interface
	Reprogram
	Wait-state management - NOTE: I emailed Cliff, further updates coming

Kernel functions we still need to implement:
	flash_close()
	wdt_*()
		wdt_start();
		wdt_ping();
		wdt_stop();
		wdt_set_max();
	reset()
	Kernel WIC Controller...

Wrapper functions we need to implement:
	get_pressed() - returns a bitmask of currently pressed keys - Done (untested) -David D
	unix file wrapper (see file changes) - Done (untested) - David D.

Things we need to figure out:
	None Currently

Things Cliff should know about:
	Compiler Warnings:
		Comparison of unsigned value to -1 or >= 0 - REPORTED
		Implicit cast from int to enum - REPORTED
		Deprecated function definitions (pre-ansi no argument defs) - REPORTED
		??Unused variables in functions - NOT REPORTED
		Implicit cast from signed to unsigned (and unsigned to signed) - REPORTED
		Assignment in condition - REPORTED
		Non-void function does not return value - REPORTED

	Compiler Errors:

	Bugs:
		edit.c 114:
		  clipStartFrame -= adjustmentFrames; (clipStartFrame is unsigned, overflow possible)

	Inefficient porting:
		Button interface - Should be rewritten
		some issues with context (isPaused) - our audio keeps track of that

Things to ask Cliff:
	- Does he anticipate any 16-32 bit architecture issues
		- manipulate pointers as char * then read as int?
		- endianness issues?
	- Passing arguments to fs write call (address to uint32_t, shift left by 1?) - related to last Q?? - WORD ADDRESSED
	- Do the pseudo-constant porting
	- wait functions
	- wordsFromFrames, framesFromBytes, framesFromMSec - What do they do? - convert time for cutting off audio
	- ask about SCAM_Status() - expected result when paused? when stopped? - only really care if its stopped
	- ask about Snd_A1800_GetCurrentTime - returns samples, ms, what? - ms
	- SACMGet_A1800FAT_Mode() - What does this do? - just to play for for G+
	- RES_BIP/DING_A18_SA - Constant?  Can I use #define? - addresses (not strings)
	- InitVoltage() - Voltage monitoring interfaces? - 
					device.h header (defines, v_min_usb_voltage 1.9V) check voltage for record-reprog to ensure no FS corruption
	- RTC interfaces? real time, time since startup, etc? - Time since core started

things cliff wants:
	how long has a button been held down?

Sleep:
	mainLoop:
		checkInactivity?
			check to see if connected
			goto sleep state
